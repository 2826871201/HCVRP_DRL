# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Solving the Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem

Attention based model for learning to solve the Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (HCVRP) with both min-max and min-sum objective. Training with REINFORCE with greedy rollout baseline.

## Dependencies

* Python>=3.6
* NumPy
* SciPy
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)=0.4
* tqdm
* [tensorboard_logger](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/tensorboard_logger)
* Matplotlib (optional, only for plotting)

## Details
For more details, please see the fleet_v3 and fleet_v5 for HCVRP with three vehicles and five vehicles, respectively.
